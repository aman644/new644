I consider my story a little different .I studied humanities during my high school years and afterwards I went for graduation in the same field, I wanted to serve my country by becoming a civil executive, I was pretty commited to my ambition, during my studies I realised I am studing all this to become a cog of the machinery which has decayed beyond repair and I would end up being like rest of them, every year thousands of student prepare for this exam to become a officier and study history, political science, sociology and develop no skill what so ever, my country needs skilled youth who can contribute to its G.D.P, its economy. I realised being an executive means you have to implement laws made by the guys who are barely qualified to be law makers. I love my motherland but the prevailing system in my country is something I dont agree with and hence I choose not to be a part of it out of my own integrity. I choose data science,its a new path for me, I have no background in computers, but its never late to acquire new set of skills and every day I learn something new, everyday brings me a step closer to become economiclly independent and create something new.Every day I feel terrible that I would fail, no one will hire me and I would end up being a deadbeat and every day I fight that feeling, I convince myself I will make it big.
